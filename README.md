Values
======================

The Values module is an interface for managing reusable sets of value-label
pairs. The purpose is to allow lists of values to be reused across the
website, without having the configure them in multiple locations.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.
  
To use this module, go into the Values administration page, at
admin/content/values, and you will see a table with the currently configured
value sets.

To add a new value set, click on Add and fill out the information. You will be
able to define the value-label pair for each option.
